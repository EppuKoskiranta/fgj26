Applying the mask/lotion
===

Top down camera on the customer's face.

Jar of lotion.
Hand.

Mouse.
Click.
Drag.
Paint.

Lotion runs out gradually while applying, making the player fetch more lotion from the jar.


# Lotion jar object

Has getLotion() which gives the player some amount of lotion on the hand.


# Facial coverage detection

Implementation is unclear, TBD.

Face has a texture/normal mask, lotion has some mask

The expected output is some function, "getResult()" which returns a ratio of lotion coverage, from 0.0 to 1.0.
